                <h2>Summary:</h2>
                <p>
                    Cordelia Carstairs has endured tragedy and fled to Paris with Matthew Fairchild in an 
                    attempt to escape it. However, her demons persist, compelling her to return to London 
                    to confront Belial. When the Herondale family’s ancestral secret is revealed, they 
                    become suspects in making deals with demons. Cordelia and the Merry Thieves find 
                    themselves trapped in London, away from their families, and are the Shadowhunters' 
                    only hope of saving the world.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Analysis:</h2>
                <h3>Character Development</h3>
                <p class="analysis">
                    In this installment, character development was more pronounced across the board, 
                    a welcome change from previous books in the series. However, just as we start to 
                    delve deeper into a particular character, they are unexpectedly killed off, which 
                    felt unnecessary and shocking. Cordelia's choices at the beginning seemed out of 
                    character, indicating a backwards development that might be attributed to her trauma. 
                    On the other hand, James's arc was brilliantly executed. He confronts his past and 
                    reaches a level of acceptance that is deeply satisfying.

                </p>

                <h3>Themes</h3>
                <p class="analysis">
                    Friendship is a dominant theme throughout this series, and it's heartwarming to 
                    witness the strong bonds, especially among the Merry Thieves. A memorable moment 
                    was Matthew's confession about his haunting past and his friends' unwavering 
                    acceptance. It was a truly beautiful scene.

                </p>

                <h3>Likes and Dislikes</h3>
                <p class="analysis">
                    Cordelia's decision to flee to Paris with Matthew was one of my least favourite 
                    aspects of the book. Matthew's self-torture was also hard to digest. Conversely, 
                    I was thrilled when Alastair and Tom finally got together. It took a while, 
                    but the payoff was heartwarming and rewarding.

                </p>

                <h2>Recommendation:</h2>
                <p> I recommend this book to those who enjoy a good slow-burn romance coupled with high 
                    stakes. It's also perfect for readers who appreciate strong friendships and the 
                    triumph of good over evil.
