            <h2>My Why</h2>
            <p>
                <!-- Image of a group reading -->

                <!-- Text explaining the motivation behind the Fantasy Book Club -->
                The best stories I read when I was a kid were ones where reality played no part. I was captivated by the characters 
                that were beyond my imagination, the ones with magic and that sense of the unexplainable. It was through reading C.S. 
                Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia that I first fell in love with fantasy. Lewis had managed to capture how I felt about 
                the genre and put it in words. He painted a picture of a beautiful world in which people like you and me have the 
                potential to exist in such a wonderful world and to be something we never expected to be. For me, reading fanatasy 
                allows for the possibility of exploring worlds we could never have imagined and be inspired by the characters that we 
                want to become. 
            </p>

                <!-- Continuing the explanation of the motivation behind The Fantasy Book Club -->
                I created The Fantasy Book Club to find like minded people and to bring them on my journey of discovery. Even though I 
                have been reading fantasy for most of my life, I haven't begun to uncover the millions of worlds and stories that exist. 
                That thought is the most exciting thing. I want to discover what the beautiful people of this world imagine and what 
                stories they want to tell, whether they are true stories or just stories they want to be true.

                I also have personally dealt with social anxiety and the pressure to particpate in social events. Because of this, 
                users of this website have a choice about how much interaction they have with other users and the content. Nothing is 
                mandatory. You get what you want out of the experience.

            <!-- Personal introduction section -->
            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Holly Robinson. I'm a nearly graduated master's student from Australia. I grew up in a small (population 
                of 4,600 small) coastal town in New South Wales. My parents fostered a love of books in me from a very young age. 
                They often tell me how they read to me every night, right from the day I was born. So my addiction is completely 
                their fault and the reason I hoard books and spend all my money. Growing up my family were really the only other 
                people I encountered that were equally obsessed with books. Still to this day I am yet to share this passion 
                with the people in my closest circle. I want to change that,  so I'm glad you're here.
            </p>
            <!-- Our story section -->
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                We are still very much in the beginning stages of The Fantasy Book Club. But plans are already in place for the future. 
                I want this club to grow into a vibrant community that supports one another in their discovery journey and share their 
                passion. And let's hope we succeed in providing a convenient and comprehensive fantasy book club experience. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for being a part of our story!
