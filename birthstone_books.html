                    <p style="text-align: center;">I found this wonderful article idea on Instagram where you find books with the cover 
                        colours or titles matching your birthstone. I was born in February, so my birthstone 
                        is Amethyst! 
                    </p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        I scoured the internet for books with purple covers or titles that relate to 
                        Amethyst, and I was surprised that there weren't as many options as I had hoped. 
                        However, I found a few interesting choices that I can't wait to read and share with 
                        others who have the same birthstone. This was a fun and creative way to discover new 
                        books that I might not have encountered otherwise. What is your birthstone? Maybe it's time to go through your shelves and the 
                        interent for a birthstone book for your next read.
