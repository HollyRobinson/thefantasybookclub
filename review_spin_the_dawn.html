                <h2>Favourite Quote:</h2>
                <p>"Seize the wind. Don't become the kite that never flies." - Elizabeth Lim.</p>

                <h2>Summary:</h2>
                <p>Maia Tamarin is working as a seamstress for her father and dreams of becoming the most 
                    renowned seamstress in the land. When her father is summoned to court she disguises 
                    herself as a man and goes in his place. She enters a competition between twelve men 
                    to become the royal tailor, where the final text will make or break her.</p>
                
                <h2>Analysis:</h2>
                <h3>Character Development</h3>
                <p class="analysis">
                    Edan's struggle with love wasn't sufficiently explored, which could have deepened his 
                    character. Maia, on the other hand, is portrayed consistently as strong, maintaining 
                    her identity throughout the book. Her feelings for Edan are well-explored, contrasting 
                    with the depth that could have been given to Edan's internal conflicts.
                </p>

                <h3>Themes</h3>
                <p class="analysis">
                    Loss is a central theme, haunting both main characters in different ways. For Maia, 
                    it fuels her protectiveness and drive to become the imperial tailor. Edan's loss of 
                    freedom and love for magic are sources of pain, but his love for Maia rejuvenates his 
                    passion for life, showing his transformation.
                </p>

                <h3>Likes and Dislikes</h3>
                <p class="analysis">
                    I enjoyed the vivid descriptions of Maia's dressmaking and the other competitor's 
                    creations. If I were an artist I would love to try to capture the beauty of Amana's 
                    dresses. I was not too fond of Norbu, which demonstrates Lim's writing ability, 
                    as he incites strong reactions due to his lies and potential future trouble in 
                    the sequel.
                </p>

                <h2>Recommendation:</h2>
                <p> I would recommend this book for fans of legends, as the tale of Amana's dresses is woven 
                    throughout. It appeals to those who admire characters driven by passion and who are 
                    interested in first love stories.
